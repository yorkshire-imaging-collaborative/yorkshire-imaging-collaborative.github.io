subtitle: Shared learning is a core value of our regional imaging network
  underpinning our collaborarive ethos. This guide aims to help you scale up
  your usual learning and feedback methods to suit the needs of a larger and
  wider network of reporting radiologists and radiographers.
excerpt: The R-REAL meeting is where we share peer learning and feedback from
  radiology events in our imaging network. Submit cases and earn CPD.

## What is REALM?

Radiology Events and Learning is a peer operated process championed by the Royal College of Radiologists to enable colleagues to learn from both positive and suboptimal events arising in the busy radiology workflow.

At the heart of the process is an open and kind forum to candidly discuss what went well and what can be improved next time - the REAL meeting (REALM). The meeting is carefully curated by a clinical lead who arranges and builds cases into a meeting, with the images available for review and subsequent discussion. Case discussion is not limited to image based cases, but can also focus on logistics, safety of processes and reporting.

### The Regional REALM (R-REALM)

Running a cross-regional insource reporting network presents an obvious opportunity for larger scale learning about specific cases, how we author and issue reports and processes of patient care. We appointed a Regional REALM Lead to design, administer and run the process, and to hold a monthly meeting.

#### Send someone a High Five

W﻿e all know about reporting mistakes and analysing what could have gone better but sending someone a 'high five' for a great spot or a nice report is even more important. We encourage it and have designed a process to make it easier for you to do it.

## R-REALM - What you need to know

**W﻿e run a monthly regional events and learning meeting** for 10 months of the year (missing December and August). The meeting is virtual and is hosted by our R-REALM Lead. Cases discussed are picked from those submitted by YIC users and also curated from Trust REAL meetings.

**S﻿ubmitting a case is an online process** using this form. You will be awarded with a CPD point for your submission and that will be issued immediately to add to your portfolio.

**C﻿PD Points can be obtained** by both attending meetings and submitting cases. Both of these are online processes which you can carry out from anywhere.

**A﻿ttending the R-REALM meeting contributes towards your annual attendance** quota which is defined by the Royal College of Radiologists to be 50% of meetings (i.e. at least 5 per year).

### What makes a good learning case?

* Examples of a great pickup or a good report
* Radiology which had a positive impact on care
* Events from which we can learn and improve
* Something difficult or misinterpreted with a specific learning point
